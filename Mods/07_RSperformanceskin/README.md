This is the mod for enabling full configuration from MMI UI for RSPerformance skin on Audi Q3

CAUTION: it is not a standalone mod!!! You have to enable RSPerformance skin first, by editing dataset of block 17.

CAUTION: after activation, do not select other display skins through MMI. Otherwise you will need to edit dataset again.
